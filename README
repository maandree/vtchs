NAME
	vtchs - Listen for VT switches

ETYMOLOGY
	(v)irtual (t)erminal (ch)ange(s)

SYNOPSIS
	vtchs

DESCRIPTION
	vtchs ignores all arguments. You must have set
	stdin to be a /dev/tty device.

	When vtchs starts, it prints the number of the
	currently active console. Then, in an infinite
	loop, it waits for the user to change console,
	and prints the number of the newly active console
	when this happens.

RATIONALE
	Sometimes you need to be able to know which
	console is in the foreground, and stay up to
	date on this.
